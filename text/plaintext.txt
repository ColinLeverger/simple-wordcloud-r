I am a young developer & an engineering student, and you are welcome to my web-portfolio.
I currently work as an apprentice DevOps engineer & Scala developer at the Orange
                    company. I have the opportunity to work with DevOps tools such as Jenkins,
                    Travis, Scala SBT, Docker, Ansible, and also to learn how the
                    application performance management works in the Orange's Application Performance Experts team.
I am highly motivated by the Big Data in general, and about technologies such as Machine
                        learning, etc. I am constantly learning (by myself, or at school) about these subjects, and
                    I definitely want to go further and study in that field after being graduated at ENSSAT. Let me know
                    if you are interested in my profile for a potential internship in this domain!
You will find on this website some information about me, my skills, and about some of my
                    projects.

I have a good knowledge of continuous delivery. I do not like to
                        repeat painful things, especially when it concerns the test & delivery of a
                        software I'm developing. I like to be a "lazy" (but smart though...) developer.
                        Docker, Jenkins,
                        SBT and Ansible are
                        working for me to deliver my work.
I make strong efforts to test my tools and software: without tests, the solutions are
                        not maintainable, plus it assures a non-regression of the code: and that is everything we want,
                        right? I am using SBT to test my code (because SBT is waaaaay cool and powerful). I follow a
                        Test-Driven Development process at work, and also for personal projects.
Jenkins is working hand by hand with Docker to build web and Java projects
                        automatically. A push on GitHub, and "voilÃ ", everything is packaged and
                            ready (without any intervention from me), that's all folks.
All the services I try / use are deployed on my faithful Docker. I can count on its
                        simplicity and reliability for every environment I need.
